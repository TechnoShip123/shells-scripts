# TechnoShip123's Shell Scripts

This is a repository for any shell scripts that I create. Feel free to use any of these for yourself, but please *make sure you understand what they do*. __I am not liable for anything caused by running these scripts.__


I strongly encourage improvements and suggestions for this repository, so *please* feel free to open a pull request or issue with your modifications.
